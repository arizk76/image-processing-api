## _Udacity-FWD Advanced Development Project_

## Summary

Building an API that can be used in two different ways, As a simple placeholder API, that allows to place images into any frontend with the size set via URL parameters for rapid prototyping. The second use case is as a library to serve properly scaled versions of project images to the front end to reduce page load size. Rather than needing to resize and upload multiple copies of the same image to be used throughout application site, the API  will handle resizing and serving stored images for you.

## Features

- Select an IMAGE file and choose desired width and height
- Drag and drop images (requires your Dropbox account be linked)
